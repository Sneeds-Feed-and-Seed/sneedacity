This was an old file documenting some features that Audacity wanted
to implement before the Muse Group mess. We might want to implement
these as well. Or have them merged to upstream and backport it to
our fork.

Audacity (upstream) Bugzilla for some logged enhancement issues:

Ideas on Feature Requests:

This one is super-old, but might contain some things that are useful:
https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Release_checklist_not_aiming_for_1.4

For residual things from the past still undone as at end-2012, see
upstream's todo.txt at: 
https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/master/todo.txt

They might no longer be applicable in 3.0.x though. The todo.txt in
upstream (as of writing) was last updated in 2012 after all.
