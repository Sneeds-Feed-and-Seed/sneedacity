To make PortMidi, you need cmake and the Java SDK.
Go back up to the portmidi directory and type:

ccmake .

Type 'c' (configure) and then 'g' (generate). You may have
to manually set JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH and JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY
by typing 't' (toggle to advanced mode) and using the 
editor to change the fields. You can find possible values
for JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH by typing "locate jni.h", and for
JAVA_JVM_LIBRARY by typing locate libjvm".

You also need JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2, but this will normally
be set automatically after you set JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH and
run "configure" (type "c" to ccmake). Normally,
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2 is the linux subdirectory within
JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH.

Notice that the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE can be Debug or Release.
Stick with Release if you are not debugging.

After successfully generating make files with ccmake, you
can run make:

make

The Makefile will build all test programs and the portmidi
library. For experimental software,
especially programs running from the command line, we 
recommend using the Debug version -- it will terminate your
program and print a helpful message if any PortMidi 
function returns an error code. (Released software should
check for error codes and handle them, but for quick,
non-critical projects, the automatic "print and die" 
handling can save some work.)

THE pmdefaults PROGRAM

You should install pmdefaults. It provides a graphical interface
for selecting default MIDI IN and OUT devices so that you don't
have to build device selection interfaces into all your programs
and so users have a single place to set a preference.

Follow the instructions above to run ccmake, making sure that
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Release. Run make as described above. Then:

sudo make install

This will install PortMidi libraries and the pmdefault program.
You must alos have the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH set
to include /usr/local/lib (where libpmjni.so is installed).

Now, you can run pmdefault.


SETTING LD_LIBRARY_PATH

pmdefaults will not work unless LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes a 
directory (normally /usr/local/lib) containing libpmjni.so,
installed as described above.

To set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you might want to add this to your
~/.profile (if you use the bash shell):

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


A NOTE ABOUT AMD64:

When compiling portmidi under linux on an AMD64, I had to add the -fPIC
flag to the gcc flags.

Reason: when trying to build John Harrison's pyPortMidi gcc bailed out
with this error:

./linux/libportmidi.a(pmlinux.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
./linux/libportmidi.a: could not read symbols: Bad value
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

What they said:
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/amd64/howtos/index.xml?part=1&chap=3
On certain architectures (AMD64 amongst them), shared libraries *must* 
be "PIC-enabled".

USING AUTOCONF

Sneedacity (the audio editor ) uses an autoconf-based build system, and 
the files are also included in the PortMidi download. The associated
files are tested only in the context of building Sneedacity, but if you
really prefer autoconf to cmake or want to include portmidi in another
autoconf-based project (like Sneedacity), maybe this will be useful.

The files are: configure.ac, portmidi-uninstalled.pc.in, portmidi.pc.in,
    and everything in autotools/.

To build from these files, run aclocal, which will produce
    aclocal.m4 and autom4te.cache

Run autoconf, which will produce
    configure

Run automake, which will produce
    Makefile.in

Now that you have a configure and Makefile.in, 
continue with the next section.


USING CONFIGURE

Run ./configure to produce:
    config.status
    Makefile
    portmidi.pc
    portmidi-uninstalled.pc


Finally, run make to create
