\class ODDecodeTask
\brief Decodes a file into a simpleBlockFile, but not immediately.

This is an abstract class that subclasses will have to derive the types
from.  For any type there should only be one ODDecodeTask associated with
a given track.
There could be the ODDecodeBlockFiles of several FLACs in one track (after copy and pasting),
so things aren't as simple as they seem - the implementation needs to be
robust enough to allow all the user changes such as copy/paste, DELETE, and so on.
