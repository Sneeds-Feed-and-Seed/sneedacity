  Sneedacity: A Digital Audio Editor

  Experimental.cmake

  Dominic Mazzoni
  James Crook

  Used at configuration time to generate compiler options that enable or disable
  experimental features.

  When the features become mainstream the options will then be retired.

  JKC: This file solves a problem of how to avoid forking the
  code base when working on NEW features e.g:
    - Additional displays in Sneedacity
    - Modular architecture.
  Add options in here for the NEW features, and make your code
  conditional on them with #ifdef.

  For each name in the list, EXPERIMENTAL_{name} is the token to test with
  #ifdef.

  All the options are positive, i.e., when not commented out,
  they enable the feature.

   # Define this so that sync-lock tiles shine through spectrogram.
   # The spectrogram pastes a bitmap over the tiles.
   # This makes it use alpha blending, most transparent where least intense.
   #SPECTROGRAM_OVERLAY

   # Define this so that sync-lock tiles shine through note/MIDI track.
   # The note track then relies on the same code for drawing background as
   # Wavetrack, and draws its notes and lines over the top.

   # Define this, and the option to zoom to half wave is added in the VZoom menu.
   # Also we go to half wave on collapse, full wave on restore.

   # Effect categorisation. Adds support for arranging effects in categories
   # and displaying those categories as submenus in the Effect menu.
   # This was a 2008 GSoC project that was making good progress at the half-way point
   # but then the student didn't contribute after that.  It needs a bit of work to finish it off.
   # As a minimum, if this is turned on for a release,
   # it should have an easy mechanism to disable it at run-time, such as a menu item or a pref,
   # preferrably disabled until other work is done.  Martyn 22/12/2008.
