This directory contains a series of instructions for
 comprehensively testing the Sneedacity application.  They 
should be performed on all platforms, on the latest 
build, as downloaded from the Sneedacity code repository, to help
 detect obvious bugs and regressions. 

In addition, check the file structure for missing files
 and folders, especially for missing plug-ins. Hard Limiter 
and SC4 should be present in the "Plug-Ins" folder on 
Windows and Mac, but are currently not added to Linux tarballs.
