2. Changes since version 3.0.0: (before Audacity was forked to Sneedacity)


Improvements

 * More information to help Audacity developers is now provided 
   with most error reports.
 * Manage Macros dialog is now clearer about how to save and
   close the dialog, thanks to changes in buttons.
 * In MP3 export we removed a legacy option for a slower encoding
   that is no better than the faster one.

3. Some Known Issues in 3.0.2: (before Audacity was forked to Sneedacity)

We have two significant bugs we would like help in tracking down:

1) Audacity may occasionally report "Failed to open the project 
   database".  We don't think this is causing people to lose data.
2) Audacity may offer to 'recover' a project at start up, when
   there is nothing to recover.

If there are repeatable steps to make these bugs happen, this
could help us track down what is causing them.

For best workarounds and other known issues in 3.0.2, please see:
