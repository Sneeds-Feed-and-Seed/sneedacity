#[[
A small library defining various constants and utilities

No dependencies on wxWidgets.  Very few if any symbols with linkage.

One very important utility is finally() as defined in The C++ Programming
Language, fourth edition, for describing ad-hoc RAII actions.

Historically, MemoryX.h began as a wrapper of C++11 <memory>, which by itself
did not yet provide std::make_unique.  That explains the name.

Sneedacity now uses C++14, and yet, need arose for other anticipations of
future standards, such as with optional.  It also provides other pervasively
used utilities that don't correspond to things in the standard.
